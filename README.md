   This repository contains the two files for the final assignment in the Getting and Cleaning Data class by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. The first file is this README that explains the function of the second file, run_analysis.R, and how to implement it.
========================================================
   The script run_analysis.R takes two data sets from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0 and outputs the mean of six variables by "Activity" and "Subject". It also creates a text file with the same information.
   The script should be run from the working directory with the data sets labled "X_test.txt", "X_train.txt" and with corresponding lables from "y_test.txt", "y_train.txt" respectively. The files "subject_test.txt" and "subject_train.txt" are also used to label the "Subject" carrying out the "Activity". The output file is named "analysis.txt".
